# TI-BASIC-toolbox
here are some programs for `TI-8[3 4](+)? (SE)?` etc calculators (that support TI-BASIC) 

**WARNING**: only files in the `8xp` directory can be sent directly to the calculators. *Files in `src` are just text and will **not** run if sent to calculators; they exist only for conveniently veiwing the source code.*

*note: after programs are sent to the calculator, they may be archived by default. This prevents them from being delted when clearing RAM. To use them, unarchive them by going to `[2nd] [mem] [6]` and then the program, from `[pgrm]`. For example, when unarchiving pgrmINTREST, you should get the command `unarchive pgrmINTREST` with the steps indicated above, then hit enter."

To edit `.8xp` files (*in the `8xp` directory*) , use somehting along the lines of [SourceCoder](https://www.cemetech.net/sc/) (in browser) or TICoder (executable binary) on the computer. You could also paste the contents of the source files into those editors. 
Alternatively, download them onto your calculator and edit them there; `8xp` files can be transfered using [TI-Connect](http://education.ti.com/en/us/products/computer_software/connectivity-software/ti-connect-software/features/features-summary) (official, for windows) or [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilp/) (for linux).
